## Quick Summary

Confident AI keeps track of your evaluation histories in both development and deployment and allows you to:

- visualize evaluation results
- compare and select optimal hyperparameters (eg. prompt templates, model used, etc.) for each test run

## Visualize Evaluation Results

Once logged in via `deepeval login`, all evaluations executed using `deepeval test run`, `evaluate(...)`, or `dataset.evaluate(...)`, will automatically have their results available on Confident.

## Compare Hyperparameters

Begin by associating hyperparameters with each test run:

```python title=test_example.py
import deepeval
from deepeval import assert_test
from deepeval.metrics import HallucinationMetric

def test_hallucination():
    metric = HallucinationMetric()
    test_case = LLMTestCase(...)
    assert_test(test_case, [metric])


# Just an example of prompt_template
prompt_template = """You are a helpful assistant, answer the following question in a non-judgemental tone.

Question:
{question}
"""

# Although the values in this example are hardcoded,
# you should ideally pass in variables to keep things dynamic
@deepeval.log_hyperparameters(model="gpt-4", prompt_template=prompt_template)
def hyperparameters():
    # Any additional hyperparameters you wish to keep track of
    return {
        "chunk_size": 500,
        "temperature": 0,
    }
```

You **MUST** provide the `model` and `prompt_template` argument to `log_hyperparameters` in order for `deepeval` to know which LLM and prompt template you're evaluating.

:::note
This only works if you're running evaluations using `deepeval test run`. If you're not already using `deepeval test run` for evaluations, we highly recommend you to start using it.
:::

That's all! All test runs will now log hyperparameters for you to compare and optimize on.
